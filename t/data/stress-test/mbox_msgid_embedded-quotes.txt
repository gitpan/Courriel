Subject:  tomcat 5.0.19 randomly stops taking http requests

   Tomcat 5.0.19 is actually still running, but stops taking http request=
s
   randomly. It will run just fine for one or two weeks, then in the midd=
les
   of the night, or over the weekend when no one is using tomcat at all, i=
t
   stops taking requests (I know when it happens because I have a standal=
one
   application that tries retrieving a webpage from Tomcat every half hou=
r to
   check if it's still up).
   The catalina.out log file doesn't show anything unusual, it's actually=

   still running, so is the Tomcat process. But trying to reach a web pag=
e
   will show a timeout error on any browser. And sometimes trying to shut=
down
   tomcat after it's hung doesn't work, I have to manually kill the tomca=
t
   process.
   I am using JVM 1.4.2_02.
   Any help would be appreciated, Thanks.
   ps. I am new to using this mailing list, and have a question, is it
   required to subscribe to the tomcat-user list in order to ask question=
s?
   or can I just send emails to the list and replies will get sent back
   directly to my email address?
