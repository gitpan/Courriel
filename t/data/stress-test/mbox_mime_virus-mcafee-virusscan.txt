Hello, this is a message from Mail Delivery Subsystem of vscan.pagitz.local.

*** ATTENTION ***

There were problems delivering your message to the following recipient:


<office@pagitz-baustoffe.at>

Your message was infected with a virus. You should download a virus
scanner and check your computer for viruses.

Sender:    <tomcat-user@jakarta.apache.org>
Recipient: <office@pagitz-baustoffe.at>

*** WHAT YOU SHOULD DO ***

If you are the recipient of the message (listed under "recipient" above),
you can safely ignore this message. If you are, however, the sender
(listed under "sender" in the list above) you should take the following
actions:

http://www.mcafee.com and http://www.symantec.com offer free trial
versions of their virus scanners which can remove the virus from your
computer. Download them and remove the virus as soon as possible.

McAfee offers an online scan which allows you to scan your computer for
viruses without having to download and install a program.
(see http://www.mcafee.com/myapps/vso/ov_scan.asp)

If you didn't send a message containing a virus (or at least an attach-
ment), please warn the other users in your address book about the
virus.


*** WHAT YOU SHOULD NOT DO ***

First of all: Don't reply to this message. This is an automated message
and your replies will be deleted automatically. Then, download a virus
scanner; do not ignore this message as some viruses have quite damaging
payloads (such as erasing the BIOS, deleting files, etc.) which might
not affect you if you download a virus scanner and delete the virus as
soon as possible.

*** WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES ARE ***

This message has been sent to both, sender and recipient. A copy of
your original message is kept securely on the mail-server; moreover
the postmaster has been informed about the message containing the
virus. Your IP-address and the name of the virus have been logged
to the mail servers security log. This is necessary in case we need
to trace back the origin of the message.

The original message was NOT delivered to the recipient. In fact, a
copy containing the virus has been archived and the original message
has been deleted.

*** THE VIRUS-SCANNER'S REPORT ***

The following output was generated by the virus scanner and might help
you identifying the virus. You might want to take a look at the virus-
databases of Symantec and McAfee which most likely can give you a
detailed description of the virus and tell you how to remove it.
