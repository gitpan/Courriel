I am on Solaris 8 and have scripted a netstat -an | grep 8009 | grep -c
ESTABLISHED.  Weighing total grep -c 8009 vs grep 8009 | grep -c ESTABLISHED
I'm getting numbers like 847 vs 542.  I'm assuming that ESTABLISHED should
not rise above maxConnections + acceptCount.  Most of the other connections
are in the SYN_SENT state.

Any other tools outside of third party profilers?

First of all, don't mistake dead sockets for established connections.
What is the socket state as reported by netstat?  What's your OS by the
way?

With a profiler, e.g. OptimizeIt or JProbe, good logging, and code
inspections.  OptimizeIt will attach to tomcat 4.x out of the box.
